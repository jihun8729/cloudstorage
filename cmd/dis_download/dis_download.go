Note that during this process, distributed binary files stored remote will be 
requeted from the remotes and decoded in the process to be downloaded in the 
destination path. If some of the partitioned files have been lost or damaged
during this process, an automatic recovery process will be used to restore the 
original file. Erasure Coding is using Reed Solomon is used during this process
and parity blocks are used to restore the file. If the damage goes over a
threshhold, recovery of the file can be difficult.

Downloading the file does not erase the distributed binary files in the remote.
To erase the files, use the dis_rm command instead.
